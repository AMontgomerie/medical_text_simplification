under conditions of high humidity , the rate of evaporation of sweat from the skin decreases .
the lack of oxygen above 2,400 metres ( 8,000 ft ) can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness , high altitude pulmonary edema , and high altitude cerebral edema .
the human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster , having a higher heart rate , and adjusting its blood chemistry .

arm-onset patients may experience difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt , writing , or turning a key in a lock .
other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing , cramping , or stiffness of affected muscles ; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg ; and\/or slurred and nasal speech .
the disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons .
unable to function , the muscles weaken and exhibit atrophy .
about 75 % of people contracting the disease experience `` limb onset '' als , i.e. , first symptoms in the arms or legs .
these patients first notice difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing .
patients with the leg onset form may experience awkwardness when walking or running or notice that they are tripping or stumbling , often with a `` dropped foot '' which drags gently along the ground .
susceptible animals include cattle , water buffalo , sheep , goats , pigs , antelope , deer , and bison .
north america and australia have been free of fmd for many years .
just as humans may spread the disease by carrying the virus on their clothes and bodies , animals that are not susceptible to the disease may still aid in spreading it .
such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in , around and secreted from the genital regions .
there is an increased risk of sti transmission if the receiving partner has wounds on his genitals , or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in his or her mouth , or bleeding gums .
these wounds , even when they are microscopic , increase the chances of contracting stis that can be transmitted orally under these conditions .
chlamydia , human papillomavirus ( hpv ) , gonorrhea , herpes , hepatitis ( multiple strains ) , and other sexually transmitted infections ( stis\/stds ) , can be transmitted through oral sex .
brushing the teeth , flossing , undergoing dental work soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission , because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth .
any sexual exchange of bodily fluids with a person infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , poses a risk of infection .
risk of sti infection , however , is generally considered significantly lower for oral sex than for vaginal or anal sex , with hiv transmission considered the lowest risk with regard to oral sex .
human fertility depends on factors of nutrition , sexual behavior , culture , instinct , endocrinology , timing , economics , way of life , and emotions .
in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles are anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year .
as a measure , `` fertility rate '' is the number of offspring born per mating pair , individual or population .
according to a computer simulation run by henri leridon , phd , an epidemiologist with the french institute of health and medical research , of women trying to get pregnant , without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization studies of actual couples trying to conceive have come up with higher results : one 2004 study of 770 european women found that 82 % of 35-to-39-year-old women conceived within a year , while another in 2013 of 2,820 danish women saw 78 % of 35-to-40-year-olds conceive within a year .

methylene blue has been used in those not responsive to other measures due to its presumed effect of relaxing smooth muscle .
people with atopic diseases such as asthma , eczema , or allergic rhinitis are at high risk of anaphylaxis from food , latex , and radiocontrast but not from injectable medications or stings .
anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death .
one study in children found that 60 % had a history of previous atopic diseases , and of those who die from anaphylaxis more than 90 % have asthma .
worldwide , 0.05-2 % of the population is estimated to have anaphylaxis at some point in life , and rates appear to be increasing .
other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva .
skin testing is available to confirm penicillin allergies , but is not available for other medications .
while a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common , a bezold-jarisch reflex has been described in 10 % of cases , where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure .
pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are a type of anaphylaxis that does not involve an allergic reaction but is due to direct mast cell degranulation .
these include agents such as contrast medium , opioids , temperature ( hot or cold ) , and vibration .
anaphylactic shock is associated with systemic vasodilation that causes low blood pressure which is by definition 30 % lower than the person 's baseline or below standard values .
intravenous epinephrine however has been associated both with dysrhythmia and myocardial infarction .
it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma , syncopy , and panic attacks .
in the immunologic mechanism , immunoglobulin e ( ige ) binds to the antigen ( the foreign material that provokes the allergic reaction ) .
non-immunologic mechanisms involved substances that directly cause the degranulation of mast cells and basophils .
the most common areas affected include : skin ( 80-90 % ) , respiratory ( 70 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 30-45 % ) , heart and vasculature ( 10-45 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10-15 % ) with usually two or more being involved .
those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from anaphylaxis .
the wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling .
on a mechanistic level , anaphylaxis is caused by the release of mediators from certain types of white blood cells triggered either by immunologic or non-immunologic mechanisms .
the precise location of storage is unknown , but the temporal cortex has been proposed as a likely candidate .
the cause of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown , but established risk factors include male sex , smoking , and a family history of pneumothorax .

however , in infants , hiv\/aids patients , and others with weakened immunity , infection can cause serious and occasionally fatal illness ( toxoplasmosis ) .
although mild , flu-like symptoms occasionally occur during the first few weeks following exposure , infection with t. gondii generally produces no symptoms in healthy human adults .
infection in humans and other warm-blooded animals can occur although t. gondii can infect , be transmitted by , and asexually reproduce within humans and virtually all other warm-blooded animals , the parasite can sexually reproduce only within the intestines of members of the cat family ( felids ) .
in humans , it is one of the most common parasites ; serological studies estimate that up to a third of the global population has been exposed to and may be chronically infected with t. gondii , although infection rates differ significantly from country to country .

the development of quarantine in the medieval period helped mitigate the effects of other infectious diseases .
in other cases , treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others , such as during an outbreak of infectious disease , or contamination of food or water supplies .
dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century , is widely credited to public health achievements , such as vaccination programs and control of many infectious diseases including polio , diphtheria , yellow fever and smallpox ; effective health and safety policies such as road traffic safety and occupational safety ; improved family planning ; tobacco control measures ; and programs designed to decrease non-communicable diseases by acting on known risk factors such as a person 's background , lifestyle and environment .

the presence of igm in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection , whereas igg indicates an infection sometime in the past .
immune responses can also be produced by vaccines , which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection .
viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus .
not all virus infections produce a protective immune response in this way .
however , some viruses including those that cause aids and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections .
they are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme , e.g. zidovudine and lamivudine .
when the adaptive immune system of a vertebrate encounters a virus , it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and often render it non-infectious .
this comprises cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a non-specific manner .
when such a virus infects a cell , it releases its rna molecule or molecules , which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the rna into smaller pieces .
examples of the second type are the hepadnaviridae , which includes hepatitis b virus .
other viruses , called neurotropic viruses , are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them .
bacteria , like plants , have strong cell walls that a virus must breach to infect the cell .
this may be due to a lowered immunity in general ( diabetes , steroid use , hiv infection , age ) or because the host 's immune system does not have a b cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen .
pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases , because there is little revenue potential .
vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease .
even if the host develops antibodies , the human immune system is not perfect and in any case the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection immediately .
one challenge in vaccine development is economic : many of the diseases most demanding a vaccine , including hiv , malaria and tuberculosis , exist principally in poor countries .
beside the active vaccine itself , the following excipients are commonly present in vaccine preparations : many vaccines need preservatives to prevent serious adverse effects such as staphylococcus infection , which in one 1928 incident killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative .
although the benefits of preventing suffering and death from serious infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following immunization , disputes have arisen over the morality , ethics , effectiveness , and safety of vaccination .
vaccines can be prophylactic ( example : to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or `` wild '' pathogen ) , or therapeutic ( e.g. , vaccines against cancer are also being investigated ; see cancer vaccine ) .
a vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe , its toxins or one of its surface proteins .
examples include the viral diseases yellow fever , measles , rubella , and mumps , and the bacterial disease typhoid .
it can be an irritant to people with respiratory conditions such as asthma or bronchitis .

the united states environmental protection agency defines food waste for the united states as `` uneaten food and food preparation wastes from residences and commercial establishments such as grocery stores , restaurants , and produce stands , institutional cafeterias and kitchens , and industrial sources like employee lunchrooms '' .
definitions also vary because certain groups do not consider ( or have traditionally not considered ) food waste to be a waste material , due to its applications .
some of the food waste produced by processing can be difficult to reduce without affecting the quality of the finished product .
in subsistence agriculture , the amounts of food waste are unknown , but are likely to be insignificant by comparison , due to the limited stages at which waste can occur , and given that food is grown for projected need as opposed to a global marketplace demand .
losses in the nutritional value , caloric value and edibility of crops , by extremes of temperature , humidity or the action of micro-organisms , also account for food waste ; these `` qualitative losses '' are more difficult to assess than quantitative ones .
although this can conflict with efforts to reuse food waste ( such as in animal feed ) , safety regulations are in place to ensure the health of the consumer ; they are vitally important , especially in the processing of foodstuffs of animal origin ( e.g. meat and dairy products ) , as contaminated products from these sources can lead to and are associated with microbiological and chemical hazards .

the cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza .
symptoms are mostly due to the body 's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves .
the viruses may survive for prolonged periods in the environment ( over 18 hours for rhinoviruses ) and can be picked up by people 's hands and subsequently carried to their eyes or nose where infection occurs .
this may occur due to cold induced changes in the respiratory system , decreased immune response , and low humidity increasing viral transmission rates , perhaps due to dry air allowing small viral droplets to disperse farther and stay in the air longer .

further variation exists ; thus , specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type , geographical location where first isolated , sequential number of isolation , year of isolation , and ha and na subtype .
this reduced rate of antigenic change , combined with its limited host range ( inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ) , ensures that pandemics of influenza b do not occur .
sixteen h subtypes ( or serotypes ) and nine n subtypes of influenza a virus have been identified .
the first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates , including birds ( see also avian influenza ) , humans , and other mammals .
the serotypes that have been confirmed in humans , ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths , are : influenza b virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen , and is less common than influenza a. the only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza b infection is the seal .
examples of the nomenclature are : the type a viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and cause the most severe disease .
influenza a viruses are further classified , based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin ( ha or h ) and neuraminidase ( na or n ) .
however , influenza c is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children .
this type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type a and consequently is less genetically diverse , with only one influenza b serotype .
as a result of this lack of antigenic diversity , a degree of immunity to influenza b is usually acquired at an early age .
influenza a and c infect multiple species , while influenza b almost exclusively infects humans .
the influenza c virus infects humans and pigs , and can cause severe illness and local epidemics .
there are three genera of influenza virus : influenzavirus a , influenzavirus b and influenzavirus c. each genus includes only one species , or type : influenza a virus , influenza b virus , and influenza c virus , respectively .
however , influenza b mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible .

in 1765 , dr john fewster published a paper in the london medical society entitled `` cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox '' , but he did not pursue the subject further .
moreover , he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person , not just directly from cattle .
jenner inoculated phipps in both arms that day , subsequently producing in phipps a fever and some uneasiness , but no full-blown infection .
in the years following 1770 , at least five investigators in england and germany ( sevel , jensen , jesty 1774 , rendell , plett 1791 ) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox .
donald hopkins has written , `` jenner 's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox , but that he then proved ( by subsequent challenges ) that they were immune to smallpox .
noting the common observation that milkmaids were generally immune to smallpox , jenner postulated that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox ( a disease similar to smallpox , but much less virulent ) protected them from smallpox .
for example , dorset farmer benjamin jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774 , but it was not until jenner 's work some 20 years later that the procedure became widely understood .
edward jenner , frs ( 17 may 1749 - 26 january 1823 ) was an english physician and scientist from berkeley , gloucestershire , who was the pioneer of smallpox vaccine , the world 's first vaccine .
he scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of sarah nelmes , a milkmaid who had caught cowpox from a cow called blossom , whose hide now hangs on the wall of the st george 's medical school library ( now in tooting ) .
he died on may 8 , 1985 , of lung fibrosis , at sacred heart general hospital in the neighboring city of eugene .
before regular communication had been established between the two hemispheres , the varieties of domesticated animals and infectious diseases that jumped to humans , such as smallpox , were strikingly more numerous in the old world than in the new .
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection or irritation .
the flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth .
the bone marrow of a normal healthy adult produces more than 100 billion neutrophils per day , and more than 10 times that many per day during acute inflammation .
innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection , and are found in all classes of plant and animal life .
also , mucus traps infectious agents .
histamine dilates blood vessels , causing the characteristic signs of inflammation , and recruits neutrophils and macrophages .
the innate leukocytes include : natural killer cells , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils ; and the phagocytic cells including macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells , and function within the immune system by identifying and eliminating pathogens that might cause infection .
neutrophils , along with two other cell types ; eosinophils and basophils ( see below ) , are known as granulocytes due to the presence of granules in their cytoplasm , or as polymorphonuclear cells ( pmns ) due to their distinctive lobed nuclei .
in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract , movement due to peristalsis or cilia , respectively , helps remove infectious agents .
the phagocytic cells of the immune system include macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells .
pathogens also stimulate the macrophage to produce chemokines , which summons other cells to the site of infection .
neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the site of an infection .
the innate immune system , also known as non-specific immune system and first line of defense , is a subsystem of the overall immune system that comprises the cells and mechanisms that defend the host from infection by other organisms in a non-specific manner .
inflammation is stimulated by chemical factors released by injured cells and serves to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection , and to promote healing of any damaged tissue following the clearance of pathogens .
by helping to remove dead cells preceding growth and development of new healthy cells , phagocytosis is an important part of the healing process following tissue injury .
the major functions of the vertebrate innate immune system include : the epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents , acting as the first line of defense against invading organisms .
the main products of the neutrophil respiratory burst are strong oxidizing agents including hydrogen peroxide , free oxygen radicals and hypochlorite .
chemical factors produced during inflammation ( histamine , bradykinin , serotonin , leukotrienes , and prostaglandins ) sensitize pain receptors , cause vasodilation of the blood vessels at the scene , and attract phagocytes , especially neutrophils .
when host cells die , either internally induced by processes involving programmed cell death ( also called apoptosis ) or caused by cell injury due to a bacterial or viral infection , phagocytic cells are responsible for their removal from the affected site .
although his time there was marked by variable health from asthma attacks , he nevertheless became an intellectual hero of the whigs .
events that happened during locke 's lifetime include the english restoration , the great plague of london and the great fire of london .
in 1666 , he met lord anthony ashley cooper , 1st earl of shaftesbury , who had come to oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection .
locke 's medical knowledge was put to the test when shaftesbury 's liver infection became life-threatening .
locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading shaftesbury to undergo an operation ( then life-threatening itself ) to remove the cyst .
the newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics , because they do not contain phenylalanine .

the 1997 classification divided dengue into undifferentiated fever , dengue fever , and dengue hemorrhagic fever .
dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma .
terms for severe disease include `` infectious thrombocytopenic purpura '' and `` philippine '' , `` thai '' , or `` singapore hemorrhagic fever '' .
dengue has become a global problem since the second world war and is endemic in more than 110 countries .
typically , people infected with dengue virus are asymptomatic ( 80 % ) or only have mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated fever .
the world health organization 's 2009 classification divides dengue fever into two groups : uncomplicated and severe .
a decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5-6 % of severe cases , which is attributable either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs , for example , the liver .
dengue virus is primarily transmitted by aedes mosquitoes , particularly a. aegypti .
therefore , travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home .
other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of dengue , such as transverse myelitis and guillain-barré syndrome .
other historical terms include `` breakheart fever '' and `` la dengue '' .
symptoms include fever , headache , muscle and joint pains , and a characteristic skin rash that is similar to measles .
the characteristic symptoms of dengue are sudden-onset fever , headache ( typically located behind the eyes ) , muscle and joint pains , and a rash .
dengue hemorrhagic fever was subdivided further into grades i-iv .
it is not entirely clear why secondary infection with a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome .
the term `` breakbone fever '' was applied by physician and united states founding father benjamin rush , in a 1789 report of the 1780 epidemic in philadelphia .
in a small proportion of cases the disease develops into the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever , resulting in bleeding , low levels of blood platelets and blood plasma leakage , or into dengue shock syndrome , where dangerously low blood pressure occurs .
the term dengue fever came into general use only after 1828 .
slaves in the west indies having contracted dengue were said to have the posture and gait of a dandy , and the disease was known as `` dandy fever '' .
infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rarer complications .
all tests may be negative in the early stages of the disease .
dengue fever ( uk \/ ˈdɛŋɡeɪ \/ or us \/ ˈdɛŋɡiː \/ ) , also known as breakbone fever , is a mosquito-borne tropical disease caused by the dengue virus .
dengue can occasionally affect several other body systems , either in isolation or along with the classic dengue symptoms .
some petechiae ( small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed , which are caused by broken capillaries ) can appear at this point , as may some mild bleeding from the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose .
the origins of the spanish word dengue are not certain , but it is possibly derived from dinga in the swahili phrase ka-dinga pepo , which describes the disease as being caused by an evil spirit .
there may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding , typically from the gastrointestinal tract .
tests for dengue virus-specific antibodies , types igg and igm , can be useful in confirming a diagnosis in the later stages of the infection .
the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system ; some textbooks also include sensory systems .
the peripheral nervous system ( pns ) is the part of the nervous system consisting of the nerves and ganglia outside of the brain and spinal cord .
range of mim codes : method of inheritance these codes have been used in the medical literature to provide a unified index to genetic diseases .
wherever a trait defined in this dictionary has a mim number , the number from the 12th edition of mim , is given in square brackets with or without an asterisk ( asterisks indicate that the mode of inheritance is known ; a number symbol ( # ) before an entry number means that the phenotype can be caused by mutation in any of two or more genes ) as appropriate e.g. , pelizaeus-merzbacher disease ( mim # 312080 ) is an x-linked recessive disorder .
every disease and gene is assigned a six digit number of which the first number classifies the method of inheritance .
online mendelian inheritance in man ( omim ) is a database that catalogues all the known diseases with a genetic component , and - when possible - links them to the relevant genes in the human genome and provides references for further research and tools for genomic analysis of a catalogued gene .

since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus , the presence of nonreactive h3n2 siv variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of h3n2 viruses .
the united states department of agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick , it does not block infection or shedding of the virus .
the swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness , although some people , most commonly children , can remain contagious for up to ten days .
avian influenza virus h3n2 is endemic in pigs in china , and has been detected in pigs in vietnam , increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains .
swine influenza virus ( siv ) or swine-origin influenza virus ( s-oiv ) is any strain of the influenza family of viruses that is endemic in pigs .
swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide .
these h5n1 infections may be quite common ; in a survey of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in west java , where avian flu had broken out , five of the pig samples contained the h5n1 virus .
vaccines are available for different kinds of swine flu .
as of 2009 , the known siv strains include influenza c and the subtypes of influenza a known as h1n1 , h1n2 , h2n1 , h3n1 , h3n2 , and h2n3 .
influenza viruses infect both humans and pigs , but do not infect birds .
these strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human .
swine influenza , also called pig influenza , swine flu , hog flu and pig flu , is an infection caused by any one of several types of swine influenza viruses .
of the three genera of influenza viruses that cause human flu , two also cause influenza in pigs , with influenza a being common in pigs and influenza c being rare .
in 1998 , swine flu was found in pigs in four u.s. states .
prevention of human-to-human transmission influenza spreads between humans when infected people cough or sneeze , then other people breathe in the virus or touch something with the virus on it and then touch their own face .
because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu , a differential diagnosis of probable swine flu requires not only symptoms , but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person 's recent history .
because of its limited host range and the lack of genetic diversity in influenza c , this form of influenza does not cause pandemics in humans .
females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle ; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts .

the term chlamydia infection can also refer to infection caused by any species belonging to the bacterial family chlamydiaceae .
chlamydia is a major infectious cause of human genital and eye disease .
chlamydia conjunctivitis or trachoma is a common cause of blindness worldwide .
if left untreated , chlamydial infections can cause serious reproductive and other health problems with both short-term and long-term consequences .
chlamydia can be transmitted during vaginal , anal , or oral sex , and can be passed from an infected mother to her baby during childbirth .
between half and three-quarters of all women who have a chlamydia infection of the cervix ( cervicitis ) have no symptoms and do not know that they are infected .
chlamydia infection ( from the greek , χλαμύδα meaning `` cloak '' ) is a common sexually transmitted infection in humans caused by the bacterium chlamydia trachomatis .
chlamydia infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide ; it is estimated that about 1 million individuals in the united states are infected with chlamydia .
bacterial croup may be divided into laryngeal diphtheria , bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis .
other viral causes include influenza a and b , measles , adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) .
in cases of possible secondary bacterial infection , the antibiotics vancomycin and cefotaxime are recommended .
the most common bacteria implicated are staphylococcus aureus , streptococcus pneumoniae , hemophilus influenzae , and moraxella catarrhalis .
laryngeal diphtheria is due to corynebacterium diphtheriae while bacterial tracheitis , laryngotracheobronchitis , and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are usually due to a primary viral infection with secondary bacterial growth .
while epinephrine typically produces a reduction in croup severity within 10-30 minutes , the benefits last for only about 2 hours .
drooling or a very sick appearance indicate other medical conditions .
in severe cases associated with influenza a or b , the antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors may be administered .
spasmodic croup is caused by the same group of viruses as acute laryngotracheitis , but lacks the usual signs of infection ( such as fever , sore throat , and increased white blood cell count ) .
corticosteroids , such as dexamethasone and budesonide , have been shown to improve outcomes in children with all severities of croup .
viral croup or acute laryngotracheitis is caused by parainfluenza virus , primarily types 1 and 2 , in 75 % of cases .
while other treatments for croup have been studied , none have sufficient evidence to support their use .
croup is characterized by a `` barking '' cough , stridor , hoarseness , and difficult breathing which usually worsens at night .
moderate to severe croup may be improved temporarily with nebulized epinephrine .
since croup is usually a viral disease , antibiotics are not used unless secondary bacterial infection is suspected .
during this time , the female feeds the developing offspring with a milky substance secreted by a modified gland in the uterus .

human infections with these viruses are typically incidental , as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect arthropods needed to continue the virus life cycle - man is a dead end host .
for example , early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not contagious .
the name `` yellow fever '' originated from its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims .
some types of recessive gene disorders confer an advantage in certain environments when only one copy of the gene is present .
most genetic disorders are quite rare and affect one person in every several thousands or millions .
the same disease , such as some forms of cancer , may be caused by an inherited genetic condition in some people , by new mutations in other people , and mainly by environmental causes in still other people .
a genetic disorder is an illness caused by one or more abnormalities in the genome , especially a condition that is present from birth ( congenital ) .
genetic disorders may or may not be heritable , i.e. , passed down from the parents ' genes .

thorndike 's key observation was that learning was promoted by positive results , which was later refined and extended by b.f. skinner 's operant conditioning .
max ferdinand perutz , om , ch , cbe , frs ( 19 may 1914 - 6 february 2002 ) was an austrian-born british molecular biologist , who shared the 1962 nobel prize for chemistry with john kendrew , for their studies of the structures of hemoglobin and globular proteins .
the heterozygote has a permanent advantage ( a higher fitness ) so long as malaria exists ; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time .
such a balance is seen more simply in sickle-cell anemia , which is found mostly in tropical populations in africa and india .
the sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills a huge number of people each year .
because the heterozygote survives , so does the hgbs allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate ( see and refs in sickle-cell disease ) .
an individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin , hgbs , has a short expectancy of life , whereas the life expectancy of the standard hemoglobin ( hgba ) homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal ( though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems ) .
this is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism , balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers , and selection against the standard hgba homozygotes by malaria .
the most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function .
many authors have indicated an integral link between a person 's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex .
the prefrontal cortex , also called pfc , refers to the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain , lying in front of the motor and premotor areas .
lady burdett-coutts died of acute bronchitis at her home on stratton street , piccadilly .
trans fats may significantly increase the risk of coronary heart disease .
the authors added that measurement of bpa levels in serum and other body fluids suggests the possibilities that bpa intake is much higher than accounted for , and\/or that bpa can bioaccumulate in some conditions ( such as pregnancy ) .
the authors concluded that bpa imitates the sex hormone 17b-estradiol , which leads to a rise in insulin and eventually resistance which can lead to type 2 diabetes and hypertension a panel convened by the national toxicology program ( ntp ) of the u.s. national institutes of health determined that there was `` some concern '' about bpa 's effects on fetal and infant brain development and behavior .
the chapel hill consensus statement stated that average bpa levels in people were above those that cause harm to many animals in laboratory experiments .
the vaginal opening is much larger than the urethral opening , and both openings are protected by the labia .
the human vagina is an elastic muscular canal that extends from the cervix to the vulva .
during birth , the elasticity of the vagina allows it to stretch to many times its normal diameter .
the length is approximately 7.5 cm ( 2.5 to 3 in ) across the anterior wall ( front ) , and 9 cm ( 3.5 in ) long across the posterior wall ( rear ) , making the posterior fornix deeper than the anterior .
during childbirth , the vagina provides the channel to deliver the newborn from the uterus to its independent life outside the body of the mother .
in humans , the vagina leads from the opening of the vulva to the uterus ( womb ) , but the vaginal tract ends at the cervix .

he was severely injured after falling from a truck , breaking his collarbone and sustaining a severe hit to the head .
the ability to generate memory cells following a primary infection and the consequent rapid immune activation and response to succeeding infections by the same antigen is fundamental to the role t and b cells play in the adaptive immune response .
nk cells provide rapid responses to virally infected cells and respond to tumor formation , acting at around 3 days after infection .

this idea is based on the fact that patients suffering from the fragile x syndrome , caused by a deficiency of the fmr1 gene often show autistic symptoms .
a good mouse model for the fragile x syndrome is available in the form of mice in which the fmr1 gene ( the mouse homolog of the human fmr1 gene ) has been invalidated .
when mice are exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress ( ucms ) , they start exhibiting symptoms reminiscent of major depressive disorder in humans .
however , the results were strain - and sex-specific and there did not appear to be a clear-cut correlation between the different changes , so that they finally concluded that although their data do not disprove the idea that deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis solely underlie the behavioral impairments observed in human psychiatric disorders such as depression , they do not provide support for this hypothesis either .
as expected , when mice from a strain with scant iipmf projections were rendered hyperthyroid , they showed enlarged iipmf and improved learning ability on the radial maze .
rachel 's second daughter , lucy , underwent fetal surgery for spina bifida and was later diagnosed with cerebral palsy .
doctors worried that , due to her cerebral palsy , lucy would never be able to speak or use sign language to communicate with her deaf sister , but after production of the first volume , lucy began to sign , and later , to speak .
lucy was born 8 weeks premature , with spina bifida and cerebral palsy .
this arrangement of eukaryota ( also called `` eukarya '' ) , bacteria , and archaea is called the three-domain system , replacing the traditional two-empire system .
in 1977 , carl woese proposed dividing prokaryotes into the bacteria and archaea ( originally eubacteria and archaebacteria ) because of the major differences in the structure and genetics between the two groups of organisms .
well-known examples are former united states president ronald reagan and irish writer iris murdoch , both of whom were the subjects of scientific articles examining how their cognitive capacities deteriorated with the disease .

there has been at least one case report of red bull overdose causing postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in a young athlete .
it is believed , but was not proven , that she suffered from a rare heart condition called long qt syndrome .
a february 3 , 2009 article in the daily telegraph called `` red bull ` may have triggered heart condition that killed student ' '' reported the death of a 21-year-old woman who died after drinking four cans of red bull as well as alcohol at `` social levels '' .
after visiting thailand in 1982 mateschitz had discovered that krating daeng helped cure his jet lag .
she was on medication for epilepsy and had an abnormally large heart .
as is the case with other caffeinated beverages , red bull drinkers may experience adverse effects as a result of overuse caffeine intoxication .
people suffering from psychosis are described as psychotic .
approximately three percent of people who are suffering from alcoholism experience psychosis during acute intoxication or withdrawal .
people with psychosis may have one or more of the following : hallucinations , delusions , catatonia , or a thought disorder , as described below .
risk factors include : poverty , malnutrition , deforestation and urbanization .
about 200 million people in asia , africa , south and central america and southern europe live in areas where the disease is common .
the treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired , the species of leishmania and the type of infection .
amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues , depending in part on which leishmania species is involved ( 4 ) .
some possible medications used for visceral disease include : liposomal amphotericin b , a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin , and miltefosine .
leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide .
infections in humans are caused by more than 20 species of leishmania .
which can transmit the infection leishmania .
leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies .
the world health organization has obtained discounts on some medications to treat the disease .
the genomes of three leishmania species ( l. major , l. infantum , and l. braziliensis ) have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite .
for example , in leishmania , protein-coding genes are understood to be organized as large polycistronic units in a head-to-head or tail-to-tail manner ; rna polymerase ii transcribes long polycistronic messages in the absence of defined rna pol ii promoters , and leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment .
other measures include : spraying insecticides to kill sandflies and treating people with the disease early to prevent further spread .
leishmaniasis \/ ˌliːʃməˈnaɪəsɪs \/ or leishmaniosis ( \/ liːʃˌmeɪnɪˈoʊsɪs \/ or \/ liːʃˌmænɪˈoʊsɪs \/ ) is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania and spread by the bite of certain types of sandflies .
additionally visceral disease can be diagnosed via blood tests .

gene targeting can be permanent or conditional .
after cells with the correct insertion have been selected , they can be used to contribute to a mouse 's tissue via embryo injection .
syphilis can not be contracted through toilet seats , daily activities , hot tubs , or sharing eating utensils or clothing .
many people who present with secondary syphilis ( 40-85 % of women , 20-65 % of men ) do not report previously having had the classic chancre of primary syphilis .
syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the spirochete bacterium treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum .
while secondary disease is known for the many different ways it can manifest , symptoms most commonly involve the skin , mucous membranes , and lymph nodes .
people with tertiary syphilis are not infectious .
there may be a symmetrical , reddish-pink , non-itchy rash on the trunk and extremities , including the palms and soles .
without treatment , a third of infected people develop tertiary disease .
if allergic , as in the case of early disease , doxycycline or tetracycline may be used , albeit for a longer duration .
early latent syphilis may have a relapse of symptoms .
other late presentations may be treated with once-weekly intramuscular penicillin g for three weeks .
the first-choice treatment for uncomplicated syphilis remains a single dose of intramuscular penicillin g or a single dose of oral azithromycin .
most ( 60 % ) of new cases in the united states occur in men who have sex with men .
primary syphilis is typically acquired by direct sexual contact with the infectious lesions of another person .
also , there may be argyll robertson pupils , which are bilateral small pupils that constrict when the person focuses on near objects , but do not constrict when exposed to bright light .
approximately 30 to 60 % of those exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease .
neurosyphilis refers to an infection involving the central nervous system .
syphilis is transmitted primarily by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus ; the spirochaete is able to pass through intact mucous membranes or compromised skin .
late latent syphilis is asymptomatic , and not as contagious as early latent syphilis .
the united kingdom uses a cut-off of two years for early and late latent syphilis .
the signs and symptoms of syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents ( primary , secondary , latent , and tertiary ) .
marulanda died of a heart attack on march 26 , 2008 .
he is first mentioned ( though not seen ) in planet of the spiders , when the brigadier thinks the third doctor has gone into a coma .
during a 1975 benefit concert , he collapsed on stage from a heart attack and subsequently fell into a coma that persisted for nearly nine years until his death in 1984 , at the age of 49 .
the cause of death was not reported initially , but it is mentioned that baraka had a long struggle with diabetes .
in 1796 , a catholic priest insisted that pato players who died in such a way should be denied christian burial .
since then , several other high-resolution structures have been determined by electron crystallography , including the light-harvesting complex , the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor , and the bacterial flagellum .
he died of a heart attack in 1967 .
pauling was one of the founders of the fields of quantum chemistry and molecular biology .
widespread private concerns related to penis size have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size .
the perception of having a large penis is often linked to higher self-esteem .
a study undertaken at utrecht university found that the majority of homosexual men in the study regarded a large penis as ideal , and having one was linked to self-esteem .
an adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm ( just under 3 inches ) , but otherwise formed normally , is referred to in medicine as a micropenis .
males may quite easily underestimate the size of their own penis relative to that of others , and many men who believe that their penis is of inadequate size have average-sized penises .
flaccid penis length is a poor estimate of erect length .
the most accurate measurement of the human penis comes from several measurements at different times since there is natural minor variability in size due to arousal level , time of day , room temperature , frequency of sexual activity , and reliability of measurement .
in 1995 , at the age of nineteen , perales was diagnosed with neuropathy and lost the use of her legs within three months .
williams suggested that some genes responsible for increased fitness in the younger , fertile organism contribute to decreased fitness later in life .
this is achieved by excluding high-carbohydrate foods such as starchy fruits and vegetables , bread , pasta , grains and sugar , while increasing the consumption of foods high in fat such as nuts , cream and butter .
it consists of cutting or scraping away most of the connections to and from the prefrontal cortex , the anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain .

as a child he battled rheumatic fever , hepatitis and poliomyelitis .
child development refers to the biological , psychological and emotional changes that occur in human beings between birth and the end of adolescence , as the individual progresses from dependency to increasing autonomy .
after years of illness , balanchine died on april 30 , 1983 , aged 79 , in manhattan from creutzfeldt-jakob disease , which was diagnosed only after his death .
a disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people ; it must also be infectious .
for instance , cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious .
a pandemic ( from greek πᾶν pan `` all '' and δῆμος demos `` people '' ) is an epidemic of infectious disease that has spread through human populations across a large region ; for instance multiple continents , or even worldwide .
typically , belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals , with dinner being the largest meal of the day .
wheat and rye breads are consumed in belarus , but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat .
an american society of the order of st. john was established in 1957 as a foundation to assist the order with charitable work , after 1961 focusing its efforts specifically on the st. john ophthalmic hospital in jerusalem and some other organizations aiding the sick .
black pepper ( or perhaps long pepper ) was believed to cure illness such as constipation , diarrhea , earache , gangrene , heart disease , hernia , hoarseness , indigestion , insect bites , insomnia , joint pain , liver problems , lung disease , oral abscesses , sunburn , tooth decay , and toothaches .
also , it is eliminated from the diet of patients having abdominal surgery and ulcers because of its irritating effect upon the intestines , being replaced by what is referred to as a bland diet .
the oldest , christian , died in a boating accident in 1934 , and another , harald , died from childhood meningitis .
pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in aldous huxley 's dystopian novel , brave new world , and also to a large degree in thomas pynchon 's gravity 's rainbow .
pavlov 's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science , but also popular culture .
pavlov investigated the gastric function of dogs , and later children , by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect , measure , and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions .
as pavlov 's work became known in the west , particularly through the writings of john b. watson , the idea of `` conditioning '' as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology , and the general approach to psychology that underlay it , behaviorism .
littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to pavlov 's contemporaries vladimir mikhailovich bekhterev and john b. watson , until thomas found several references that unambiguously stated pavlov did , indeed , use a bell .
it is less widely known that pavlov 's experiments on the conditional reflex extended to children , some of whom underwent surgical procedures , similar to those performed on the dogs , for the collection of saliva .
the concept for which pavlov is famous is the `` conditioned reflex '' ( or in his own words the conditional reflex : the translation of условный рефлекс into english is debatable ) he developed jointly with his assistant ivan filippovitch tolochinov in 1901 .
alongside melanie klein , she may be considered the founder of psychoanalytic child psychology : as her father put it , child analysis ` had received a powerful impetus through `` the work of frau melanie klein and of my daughter , anna freud '' ' .
during the 1970s she was concerned with the problems of emotionally deprived and socially disadvantaged children , and she studied deviations and delays in development .
wernicke 's area , which spans the region between temporal and parietal lobes , plays a key role ( in tandem with broca 's area in the frontal lobe ) in speech comprehension .
the temporal lobe is located beneath the lateral fissure on both cerebral hemispheres of the mammalian brain .
the left temporal lobe holds the primary auditory cortex , which is important for the processing of semantics in both speech and vision in humans .
mcqueen died at age 84 on december 22 , 1995 at augusta regional medical center in augusta , from burns sustained when a kerosene heater she attempted to light malfunctioned and burst into flames .
by may 1904 , chekhov was terminally ill with tuberculosis .
there is a visual cortex in each hemisphere of the brain .
research on the primary visual cortex can involve recording action potentials from electrodes within the brain of cats , ferrets , rats , mice , or monkeys , or through recording intrinsic optical signals from animals or eeg , meg , or fmri signals from human and monkey v1 .
it is located in the occipital lobe , in the back of the brain .
the left hemisphere visual cortex receives signals from the right visual field and the right visual cortex from the left visual field .
the red crescent society has helped millions of pakistanis overcome disease and disaster , by offering support services for pakistanis , which include , food , clean water , and medical services .
the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown , but it may be due to a combination of the gradual failure in the `` satellite cells '' which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers , and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival .
muscular atrophy increases the risks of falling in conditions such as ibm ( inclusion body myositis ) .
muscle atrophy results from a co-morbidity of several common diseases , including cancer , aids , congestive heart failure , copd ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , renal failure , and severe burns ; patients who have `` cachexia '' in these disease settings have a poor prognosis .
muscular atrophy affects a major number of elderly .
lemkin died of a heart attack at the public relations office of milton h. blow in new york city in 1959 , at the age of 59 .
in the human male , the urethra is about 8 inches ( 20 cm ) long and opens at the end of the penis .
in anatomy , the urethra ( from greek οὐρήθρα - ourethra ) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the genitals for the removal of fluids from the body .
the female urethra is about 4 cm in length .
the external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination .
after 6-12 h , severe hyperkalemia , also the result of muscle breakdown , can lead to cardiac arrest .
after 3-8 h , myoglobin , as a result of muscle breakdown , may start to show up in the blood plasma , which can cause the urine to turn a dark reddish , brown , or black color , and eventually lead to acute renal failure .
the event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old manon gropius , the daughter of alma mahler ( once gustav mahler 's wife ) and walter gropius .
in humans , the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black , depending on the concentration of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium ( located on the back of the iris ) , the melanin content within the iris stroma ( located at the front of the iris ) , and the cellular density of the stroma .
eye color or eye color is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris .
hazel eyes are due to a combination of rayleigh scattering and a moderate amount of melanin in the iris ' anterior border layer .
heterochromia of the eye ( heterochromia iridis or heterochromia iridum ; the common incorrect form `` heterochromia iridium '' is not correct latin ) is of two kinds .
he is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies biogen and myriad genetics , and was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors .

after jerilderie , hart went into hiding with the gang and , for most of 1879 , the gang remained shadowy and elusive figures although hart did appear at a st. kilda doctor 's surgery to be treated for a foot condition .
a patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient , terminally ill or simply terminal .
palliative care is normally offered to terminally ill patients , regardless of their overall disease management style , if it seems likely to help manage symptoms such as pain and improve quality of life .
terminal illness is a medical term commonly used to refer to a disease that will result in the death of the patient regardless of any treatment intervention .
avian influenza - known informally as avian flu or bird flu - refers to `` influenza caused by viruses adapted to birds . ''
later outbreaks of bubonic plague in italy include the city of florence in 1630-33 and the areas surrounding naples , rome and genoa in 1656-57 .
the papal city of bologna lost an estimated 15,000 citizens to the plague , with neighboring smaller cities of modena and parma also being heavily affected .
german and french troops carried the plague to the city of mantua in 1629 , as a result of troop movements associated with the thirty years ' war ( 1618-48 ) .
this outbreak of plague also spread north into tyrol , an alpine region of western austria and northern italy .
venetian troops , infected with the disease , retreated into northern and central italy , spreading the infection .
in october 1629 , the plague reached milan , lombardy 's major commercial center .
the italian plague of 1629-31 was a series of outbreaks of bubonic plague which occurred from 1629 through 1631 in northern italy .
this episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long pandemic of bubonic plague which began with the black death .
this epidemic , often referred to as great plague of milan , claimed the lives of approximately 280,000 people , with the cities of the lombardy and veneto regions experiencing particularly high death rates .
bvi is an application that can be used on a 3d full body scanner to determine individual health risk , whether the scanning hardware uses visible light optical information or otherwise .
the body volume index ( bvi ) is a new measurement for obesity , proposed as an alternative to the body mass index ( bmi ) .
a number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout , including xanthine oxidase inhibitor ( including allopurinol and febuxostat ) and uricosurics ( including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone ) .
other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count , electrolytes , renal function , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) .
however , both the white blood cells and esr may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection .
extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion .
however , a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase the risk .
pegloticase ( krystexxa ) was approved in the usa to treat gout in 2010 .
diuretics have been associated with attacks of gout .
this should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment .
urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300-360 µmol \/ l ( 5.0-6 .0 mg\/dl ) , and are continued indefinitely .
other conditions that look similar include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis .
gout was historically known as `` the disease of kings '' or `` rich man 's disease . ''
a white blood cell count as high as 40.0 × 109\/l ( 40,000 \/ mm3 ) has been documented .
gout can present in a number of ways , although the most usual is a recurrent attack of acute inflammatory arthritis ( a red , tender , hot , swollen joint ) .
hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol \/ l ( 7.0 mg\/dl ) in males and 360 μmol \/ l ( 6.0 mg\/dl ) in females .
high levels of uric acid in the blood ( hyperuricemia ) is the underlying cause of gout .
a definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid or a tophus .
about 10 % of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lifetimes .
the immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout , the former more so when used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide .
hyperuricemia is a classic feature of gout , but it occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia , and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout .
other medicines that increase the risk include niacin and aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) .
other conditions commonly complicated by gout include : polycythemia , lead poisoning , renal failure , hemolytic anemia , psoriasis , and solid organ transplants .
they are not recommended until a person has had two attacks of gout , unless destructive joint changes , tophi , or urate nephropathy exist , as medications have not been found cost-effective until this point .
three genes called slc2a9 , slc22a12 and abcg2 have been found commonly to be associated with gout , and variations in them can approximately double the risk .
long-standing elevated uric acid levels ( hyperuricemia ) may result in other symptomatology , including hard , painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi .
the increase is believed due to increasing risk factors in the population , such as metabolic syndrome , longer life expectancy and changes in diet .
xanthine oxidase inhibitors ( including allopurinol and febuxostat ) block uric acid production , and long-term therapy is safe and well tolerated , and can be used in people with renal impairment or urate stones , although allopurinol has caused hypersensitivity in a small number of individuals .
the most important differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis .
however , it may also present as tophi , kidney stones , or urate nephropathy .
gout ( also known as podagra when it involves the big toe ) is a medical condition usually characterized by recurrent attacks of acute inflammatory arthritis-a red , tender , hot , swollen joint .
its side effects ( primarily gastrointestinal upset ) limit its usage .
gout frequently occurs in combination with other medical problems .
gout has become more common in recent decades , affecting about 1-2 % of the western population at some point in their lives .
they also lead to improvement when injected into the joint ; a joint infection must be excluded , however , as steroids worsens this condition .
renal underexcretion of uric acid is the primary cause of hyperuricemia in about 90 % of cases , while overproduction is the cause in less than 10 % .
chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function .
a body mass index greater than or equal to 35 increases a male 's risk of gout threefold .
nsaids are the usual first-line treatment for gout , and no specific agent is significantly more or less effective than any other .
recent studies have found that other dietary factors once believed associated are , in fact , not , including the intake of purine-rich vegetables ( e.g. , beans , peas , lentils , and spinach ) and total protein .
gastrointestinal upset , however , depends on the dose , and the risk can be decreased by using a smaller yet still effective dose .
when levels are between 415 and 530 μmol \/ l ( 7 and 8.9 mg\/dl ) , the risk is 0.5 % per year , while in those with a level greater than 535 μmol \/ l ( 9 mg\/dl ) , the risk is 4.5 % per year .
uricosuric medications are typically preferred if undersecretion of uric acid , as indicated by a 24-hour collection of urine results in a uric acid amount of less than 800 mg , is found .
elevated levels of uric acid may also lead to crystals precipitating in the kidneys , resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy .
the occurrence of gout is partly genetic , contributing to about 60 % of variability in uric acid level .

werner huttig of the nazi party 's rassenpolitisches amt ( office of racial politics ) said that a smoking mother 's breast milk contained nicotine , a claim that modern research has proven correct .
the nazi anti-tobacco campaign included banning smoking in trams , buses and city trains , promoting health education , limiting cigarette rations in the wehrmacht , organizing medical lectures for soldiers , and raising the tobacco tax .
women who smoked were considered to be vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness ; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a german family .
adolf hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life-he used to smoke 25 to 40 cigarettes daily-but gave up the habit , concluding that it was a waste of money .
the anti-tobacco movement did not have much effect in the early years of the nazi regime and tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939 , but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945 .

building occupants complain of symptoms such as sensory irritation of the eyes , nose , throat ; neurotoxic or general health problems ; skin irritation ; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions ; and odor and taste sensations .
other causes have been attributed to contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials , volatile organic compounds ( voc ) , molds ( see mold health issues ) , improper exhaust ventilation of ozone ( byproduct of some office machinery ) , light industrial chemicals used within , or lack of adequate fresh-air intake\/air filtration ( see minimum efficiency reporting value ) .
there might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men do .
sick building causes are frequently pinned down to flaws in the heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( hvac ) systems .
symptoms are often dealt with after the fact by boosting the overall turn-over rate of fresh air exchange with the outside air , but the new green building design goal should be able to avoid most of the sbs problem sources in the first place , minimize the ongoing use of voc cleaning compounds , and eliminate conditions that encourage allergenic mold growth .

at the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina ; however , mariotte 's discovery disproved this theory .
in them , the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind , so it does not create a break in the retina .
since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc , a part of the field of vision is not perceived .
a particular blind spot known as the blind spot , physiological blind spot , `` blind point '' , or punctum caecum in medical literature , is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting photoreceptor cells on the optic disc of the retina where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc .

further inquiry should determine whether the pain is superficial or deep - whether it occurs primarily at the vaginal outlet or vaginal barrel or upon deep thrusting against the cervix .
when the vagina is dry and undilated , thrusting of the penis is painful .
when pain occurs , the woman experiencing dyspareunia may be distracted from feeling pleasure and excitement .
for men with ic , pain occurs at the moment of ejaculation and is focused at the tip of the penis .

it is a method for influencing one 's autonomic nervous system .
autogenic training is contraindicated for people with heart conditions or psychotic disorders .
these include altered heart sounds , such as a widely split s2 or second heart sound , a loud p2 or pulmonic valve closure sound ( part of the second heart sound ) , ( para ) sternal heave , possible s3 or third heart sound , and pulmonary regurgitation .
further procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses .
a swan-ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output , which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure .
the revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension .
many pathways are involved in the abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary arteries in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension .
this delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis .
a physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension .
diagnosis of pah requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension .
pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and heart failure .
a detailed family history is established to determine whether the disease might be familial .
a physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension , including a loud s2 ( pulmonic valve closure sound ) , ( para ) sternal heave , jugular venous distension , pedal edema , ascites , hepatojugular reflux , clubbing etc. .
these generally include pulmonary function tests ; blood tests to exclude hiv , autoimmune diseases , and liver disease ; electrocardiography ( ecg ) ; arterial blood gas measurements ; x-rays of the chest ( followed by high-resolution ct scanning if interstitial lung disease is suspected ) ; and ventilation-perfusion or v\/q scanning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension .
because pulmonary hypertension can be of five major types , a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous , hypoxic , thromboembolic , or miscellaneous varieties .
a history of exposure to drugs such as cocaine , methamphetamine , alcohol leading to cirrhosis , and tobacco leading to emphysema are considered significant .
pulmonary hypertension is present when mean pulmonary artery pressure exceeds 25 mm hg ( 3300 pa ) at rest .
three of these pathways are important since they have been targeted with drugs - endothelin receptor antagonists , phosphodiesterase type 5 ( pde-5 ) inhibitors , and prostacyclin derivatives .
biopsy of the lung is usually not indicated unless the pulmonary hypertension is thought to be due to an underlying interstitial lung disease ; further , lung biopsies are fraught with risks of bleeding due to the high intrapulmonary blood pressure .
paop ( pulmonary artery occlusion pressure ) and pvr ( pulmonary vascular resistance ) can not be measured directly with echocardiography .
a second conference in 1998 at évian-les-bains also addressed the causes of secondary ph ( i.e. those due to other medical conditions ) , and in 2008 , the 4th world symposium on pulmonary arterial hypertension was convened in dana point to modify the classification based on new understandings of disease mechanisms .
in addition , the increased workload of the heart causes hypertrophy of the right ventricle , making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs , ultimately causing right heart failure ( a condition known as cor pulmonale ) .
the dana point 2008 updated clinical classification system can be summarized as follows : whatever the initial cause , pulmonary arterial hypertension ( who group i ) involves the vasoconstriction or tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs .
pulmonary hypertension ( ph ) is an increase of blood pressure in the pulmonary artery , pulmonary vein , or pulmonary capillaries , together known as the lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , leg swelling and other symptoms .
this further increases the blood pressure within the lungs and impairs their blood flow .
pulmonary venous hypertension typically presents with shortness of breath while lying flat or sleeping ( orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea ) , while pulmonary arterial hypertension ( pah ) typically does not .
anton-babinski syndrome is a rare symptom of brain damage occurring in the occipital lobe .
leukemia can affect people at any age .
some leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count .
for example , people with down syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing forms of acute leukemia ( especially acute myeloid leukemia ) , and fanconi anemia is a risk factor for developing acute myeloid leukemia .
warburton arrived in a starved condition and blind in one eye .
laboratory rats have also proved valuable in psychological studies of learning and other mental processes ( barnett , 2002 ) , as well as to understand group behavior and overcrowding ( with the work of john b. calhoun on behavioral sink ) .

a study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity .
masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids .
semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged .
in this and other tribes , the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size .
in these cases , any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic .
a man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma , severe bend or other injury during intercourse or masturbation may , rarely , sustain a penile fracture or suffer from peyronie 's disease .
though research is still as yet scant , those suffering from cardiovascular disorders ( particularly those recovering from myocardial infarction , or heart attacks ) should resume physical activity ( including sexual intercourse and masturbation ) gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow .
the capacity and need to ejaculate is developed or nurtured for years from an early age but through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted .
masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases .
the study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases ( stds ) that may increase the risk of cancer instead .
in 2003 , an australian research team led by graham giles of the cancer council australia found that males masturbating frequently had a lower probability to develop prostate cancer .
the most common male masturbation technique is simply to hold the penis with a loose fist and then to move the hand up and down the shaft .
since the germ theory of disease , cleanliness has come to mean an effort to remove germs and other hazardous materials .
although previously believed that clinically active pituitary adenomas were rare , recent studies have suggested that they may affect approximately one in 1000 of the general population .
pituitary adenomas are noncancerous tumors that occur in the pituitary gland .
pituitary adenomas represent from 10 % to 25 % of all intracranial neoplasms and the estimated prevalence rate in the general population is approximately 17 % .
pituitary adenomas are generally divided into three categories dependent upon their biological functioning : benign adenoma , invasive adenoma , or carcinomas , with carcinomas accounting for 0.1 % to 0.2 % , approximately 35 % being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas .
non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign in the literal as well as the clinical sense ; however a recent meta-analysis ( fernández-balsells , et al. 2011 ) of available research has shown there are to date scant studies - of poor quality - to either support or refute this assumption .
a majority of pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an incidental finding , and are referred to as incidentalomas .
in addition , some dna polymerases also have proofreading ability ; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases .
this type of color blindness is usually a sex-linked condition .
color blindness can also be produced by physical or chemical damage to the eye , the optic nerve , or parts of the brain .
two of the most common inherited forms of color blindness are protanopia , and deuteranopia .
the typical human retina contains two kinds of light cells : the rod cells ( active in low light ) and the cone cells ( active in normal daylight ) .
the english chemist john dalton published the first scientific paper on this subject in 1798 , `` extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colors '' , after the realization of his own color blindness .
because of dalton 's work , the general condition has been called daltonism , although in english this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia alone .
there is no actual blindness but there is a deficiency of color vision .
in individuals with northern european ancestry , as many as 8 percent of men and 0.5 percent of women experience the common form of red-green color blindness .
other forms of color blindness are much more rare .
