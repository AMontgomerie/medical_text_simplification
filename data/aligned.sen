with a higher humidity , the rate of evaporation is less .
this can cause illnesses such as altitude sickness , high altitude pulmonary edema ( fluid in the lungs ) , and high altitude cerebral edema ( fluid in the brain , causing headaches and confusion ) .
the human body can deal with high altitude by breathing faster , having a higher heart rate , and changing the blood itself to have more red blood cells that can carry oxygen .

foot-and-mouth disease virus causes the disease which can infect domestic animals such as cattle , pigs , sheep , goats and deer .
while the disease is widespread around the world , north america , central america , australia , new zealand , japan , chile , and many countries in europe are considered free of fmd .
however , humans can spread fmd by carrying the virus on their clothes and body .
such contact can also lead to more mundane infections from common bacteria and viruses found in , around and secreted from the genital regions .
if the receiving partner has wounds on their genitals , or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in their mouth , or bleeding gums , this poses an increased risk of std transmission .
these wounds , even when they are microscopic , increase the chances of contracting stds that can be transmitted orally under these conditions .
diseases such as chlamydia , human papillomavirus ( hpv ) , gonorrhea , herpes , hepatitis ( multiple strains ) , and other sexually transmitted diseases ( stds ) , as well as viruses such as hiv , can be transmitted through oral sex .
brushing the teeth , flossing , undergoing dental work , or eating crunchy foods such as potato crisps relatively soon before or after giving fellatio can also increase the risk of transmission , because all of these activities can cause small scratches in the lining of the mouth .
any kind of direct contact with body fluids of a person infected with hiv , the virus that causes aids , poses a risk of infection .
the risk from most of these types of infection , however , is generally considered far lower than that associated with vaginal or anal sex .

( the combination of a slow heart rate and low blood pressure is known as bezold-jarisch reflex ) .
pseudoanaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions are older names for anaphylaxis that is not due to an allergic reaction , but is due to direct injury to mast cells ( mast cell degranulation ) .
agents that can damage these cells include contrast medium for x-rays , opioids , temperature ( hot or cold ) , and vibration .
anaphylactic shock happens when blood vessels get wider throughout most of the body ( systemic vasodilation ) , which causes low blood pressure that is at least 30 % lower than the person 's normal blood pressure or 30 % below standard values .
intravenous epinephrine , however , has been linked to irregular heartbeats ( dysrhythmia ) and heart attacks ( myocardial infarction ) .
it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish anaphylaxis from asthma , fainting due to lack of oxygen ( syncopy ) , and panic attacks .
when anaphylaxis is caused by an immune response , immunoglobulin e ( ige ) binds to the foreign material that starts the allergic reaction ( the antigen ) .
when anaphylaxis is not caused by in immune response , the reaction is due to an agent that directly damages mast cells and basophils , causing them to release histamine and other substances that are usually associated with an allergic reaction ( degranulation ) .
the most common areas affected include : skin ( 80-90 % ) , lungs and breathing pathways ( 70 % ) , stomach and intestines ( 30-45 % ) , heart and blood vessels ( 10-45 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10-15 % ) .
people who already have heart disease are at greater risk of cardiac affects from anaphylaxis .

the presence of igm in the blood of the host is used to test for acute infection , whereas igg indicates an infection sometime in the past .
immune responses can also be produced by vaccines , which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection .
viral infections in animals provoke an immune response that usually eliminates the infecting virus .
not all virus infections produce a protective immune response .
however , some viruses including those causing aids and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections .
they are susceptible to antiviral drugs that inhibit the reverse transcriptase enzyme .
when it meets a virus , it produces specific antibodies that bind to the virus and render it non-infectious .
this has cells and other mechanisms which defend the host from any infection .
when such a virus infects a cell , it releases its rna molecule .
examples of the second type are the hepadnaviridae , which includes hepatitis b virus .88 \/ 9 the body 's first line of defense against viruses is the innate immune system .
other viruses , called neurotropic viruses , move along nerves to places the immune system can not reach .
the viruses are released and are then able to infect other cells .
this may be due to a lowered immunity in general ( diabetes , steroid use , hiv infection , age ) or because the host 's immune system does not have a b cell capable of generating antibodies to that antigen .
pharmaceutical firms and biotechnology companies have little incentive to develop vaccines for these diseases , because there is little revenue potential , the financial and other risks are great .
vaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease .
even if the host develops antibodies , the immune system might still not be able to defeat the infection .
the diseases most demanding a vaccine , hiv , malaria and tuberculosis , exist principally in poor countries .
absence of any preservative in vaccine may result in adverse effects , such as staphylococcus infection that , in one 1928 incident , killed 12 of 21 children inoculated with a diphtheria vaccine that lacked a preservative .
although the benefits of using vaccines in preventing suffering and death from infectious diseases greatly outweigh the risks of rare adverse effects following administration of vaccines , disputes have arisen over the morality , ethics , effectiveness , safety of using vaccines or that vaccine safety studies are inadequate .
vaccines can be prophylactic ( e.g. to make the effects of a future infection by any natural pathogen less dangerous or stop them completely ) , or therapeutic ( e.g. vaccines against cancer ) .
a vaccine often contains something like a germ that has been weakened or killed or the germ 's toxins .
in the 20th century vaccines were introduced against diphtheria , measles , mumps , and rubella .

further variation exists ; thus , specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type , geographical location where first isolated , sequential number of isolation , year of isolation , and ha and na subtype .
this reduced rate of antigenic change , combined with its limited host range ( inhibiting cross species antigenic shift ) , ensures that pandemics of influenza b do not occur .
sixteen h subtypes ( or serotypes ) and nine n subtypes of influenza a virus have been identified .
the first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates , including birds ( see also avian influenza ) , humans , and other mammals .
the serotypes that have been confirmed in humans , ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths , are : influenza b virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen , and is less common than influenza a. the only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza b infection is the seal .
examples of the nomenclature are : the type a viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and causes the most severe disease .
influenza a viruses are further classified , based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin ( ha or h ) and neuraminidase ( na or n ) .
however , influenza c is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children .
this type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type a and consequently is less genetically diverse , with only one influenza b serotype .
as a result of this lack of antigenic diversity , a degree of immunity to influenza b is usually acquired at an early age .
influenza a and c infect multiple species , while influenza b almost exclusively infects humans .
the influenza c virus infects humans and pigs , and can cause severe illness and local epidemics .
they infect vertebrates , as follows : there are three genera of influenza virus : influenzavirus a , influenzavirus b and influenzavirus c. each genus includes only one species , or type : influenza a virus , influenza b virus , and influenza c virus , respectively .
however , influenza b mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible .

in 1765 , dr john fewster published a paper in the london medical society entitled `` cow pox and its ability to prevent smallpox '' , but he did not pursue the subject further .
moreover , he demonstrated that the protective cowpox pus could be effectively inoculated from person to person , not just directly from cattle '' .
jenner inoculated phipps in both arms that day , subsequently producing in phipps a fever and some uneasiness , but no full-blown infection .
after 1770 , at least five investigators in england and germany ( sevel , jensen , jesty 1774 , rendell , plett 1791 ) successfully tested a cowpox vaccine in humans against smallpox .
`` jenner 's unique contribution was not that he inoculated a few persons with cowpox , but that he then proved ( by subsequent challenges ) that they were immune to smallpox .
jenner thought that the pus in the blisters that milkmaids received from cowpox ( a disease similar to smallpox , but much less virulent ) protected them from smallpox .
for example , dorset farmer benjamin jesty successfully vaccinated and presumably induced immunity with cowpox in his wife and two children during a smallpox epidemic in 1774 .
edward jenner ( 17 may 1749 - 26 january 1823 ) was an english physician known for creating the vaccine for smallpox .
he scraped pus from cowpox blisters on the hands of a milkmaid .

before there was regular communication between the two hemispheres , the different types of domesticated animals and diseases were much larger in the old world than in the new .
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection or irritation .
the flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth .
the bone marrow of a normal healthy adult produces more than 100 billion neutrophils per day , and more than 10 times that many per day during acute inflammation .
innate immune systems provide immediate defense against infection , and are found in all plant and animal life .
also , mucus traps infectious agents .
histamine dilates blood vessels , causing the signs of inflammation , and recruits neutrophils and macrophages .
the innate leukocytes include : natural killer cells , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils ; and the phagocytic cells including macrophages , neutrophils and dendritic cells .
neutrophils and two other cell types ( eosinophils and basophils ) , are known as granulocytes ( because they have granules in their cytoplasm ) or polymorphonuclear cells ( pmns ) due to their distinctive lobed nuclei .
in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract , movement due to peristalsis or cilia helps remove infectious agents .
the phagocytic cells of the immune system include macrophages ) , neutrophils , and dendritic cells .
pathogens also stimulate the macrophage to produce chemokines , which summon other cells to the site of infection .
neutrophils are the most abundant type of phagocyte , with 50 to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes .
the innate immune system is the cells and mechanisms which defend the host from infections in a non-specific way .
it serves to establish a physical barrier against the spread of infection , and to promote healing of any damaged tissue after the clearance of pathogens .
by removing dead cells , phagocytosis is an important part of the healing process .
the vertebrate innate immune system : the epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that keeps out most infectious agents .
these include hydrogen peroxide , free oxygen radicals and hypochlorite .
chemical factors produced during inflammation attract phagocytes , especially neutrophils .
when host cells die , phagocytic cells remove them from the affected site .

before this , in 1997 , the who had divided the disease into undifferentiated fever , dengue fever , and dengue hemorrhagic fever .
dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic ( long-term ) diseases , like diabetes and asthma .
other names were also used for severe dengue : for example , `` infectious thrombocytopenic purpura '' , `` philippine , '' `` thai , '' and `` singapore hemorrhagic fever . ''
the disease has become a worldwide problem since the second world war .
about 80 % of people ( or 8 out of every 10 ) who are infected with the dengue virus have no symptoms , or have only mild symptoms ( like a basic fever ) .
in 2009 , the world health organization ( who ) classified , or divided , dengue fever into two types : uncomplicated and severe .
a decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5-6 % of severe cases .
dengue virus is transmitted ( or spread ) mostly by aedes mosquitoes , especially the aedes aegypti type of mosquito .
so if a person returns from an area where dengue is common , and gets a fever or other symptoms more than 14 days after he returned , he probably does not have dengue .
for example , dengue can cause transverse myelitis and guillain-barré syndrome .
for example , dengue was also called `` breakheart fever '' and `` la dengue . ''
some of the symptoms of dengue fever are fever ; headache ; a skin rash that looks like measles ; and pain in the muscles and joints .
the classic symptoms of dengue fever are a fever that begins suddenly ; a headache ( usually behind the eyes ) ; a rash ; and muscle and joint pains .
in the who 's old system of classification , dengue hemorrhagic fever was divided into four stages , called grades i-iv : dengue fever can be diagnosed by microbiological laboratory testing .
less than 5 % of people with dengue get circulatory shock , dengue shock syndrome , and dengue hemorrhagic fever .
the name `` breakbone fever '' was first used by benjamin rush , a doctor and united states `` founding father '' .
the second is dengue shock syndrome , which causes dangerously low blood pressure .
the term `` dengue fever '' was not commonly used until after 1828 .
in the west indies , slaves that had dengue were said to stand and walk like `` a dandy '' .
although this almost never happens , dengue can also cause infection of the heart and acute liver failure .
when dengue is in the early stages of the disease , all of these tests may be negative ( meaning they do not show that the person has the disease ) .
dengue fever is an infection caused by the dengue virus .
a person can have symptoms alone , or along with the classic dengue symptoms .
the person may also have mild bleeding from the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose .
some people think that it comes from the swahili phrase ka-dinga pepo .
the person can also have severe bleeding ( usually from the gastrointestinal tract . )
however , antibody tests can confirm that a person has dengue in the later stages of the infection .
the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system ( sns ) and the autonomic nervous system ( ans ) .
the peripheral nervous system , or pns , is part of the nervous system , and consists of the nerves and neurons that are outside the central nervous system ( the brain and spinal cord ) and serve the limbs and organs , for example .
range of mim codes : method of inheritance these codes have been used in the medical literature to provide a unified index to genetic diseases .
the mim number is printed in square brackets with or without an asterisk ( asterisks indicate that the mode of inheritance is known ; a number symbol ( # ) before an entry number means that the phenotype can be caused by mutation in any of two or more genes ) as appropriate .
every disease and gene is given a six digit number .

since the brain does not work , the hormone levels and blood pressure must be controlled by doctors to keep the organs alive .
since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus , the presence of non-reactive h3n2 siv variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of h3n2 viruses .
the united states department of agriculture researchers say that while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick , it does not block infection or shedding of the virus .
the swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people , most commonly children , can be contagious for up to ten days .
the bird flu virus h3n2 is endemic in pigs in china .

hepatitis c does not spread through casual contact , such as hugging , kissing , or sharing eating or cooking utensils .
in twelve of the countries in the study , more than 80 % of all iv drug users had hepatitis c. across the world , as many as ten million iv drug users are thought to have hepatitis c ; the highest totals are in china ( 1.6 million ) , the united states ( 1.5 million ) , and russia ( 1.3 million ) .
the hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) causes this disease .
because hepatitis c is spread by blood-to-blood contact , personal-care tools which come into contact with blood - like razors , toothbrushes , and manicure or pedicure equipment or any other kind of blood to blood contact - can spread the disease if they are shared .
while hepatitis c screening works very well , some countries still do not screen blood and organ donations for the disease because of the cost .
scientists do not know whether hepatitis c can be transmitted ( or spread ) through sex .
however , if a person 's hepatitis c has progressed ( or gotten worse ) so much that the person has cirrhosis or liver cancer , the person might need a liver transplant ( they might need to have surgery where they are given another person 's liver , or part of another person 's liver ) .
however , doctors say that an infected mother should not breastfeed if her nipples are cracked and bleeding , or her viral loads ( the amount of the hepatitis c virus in her blood ) are high .
hepatitis c is more likely in people who have high-risk sexual activity ( sexual actions which make them much more likely to get hepatitis c ) .
there is no vaccine that works to prevent people from getting hepatitis c. hepatitis c causes acute symptoms ( symptoms that begin quickly or last only a short time ) in just 15 % of people with the disease .
one study that looked at 77 countries showed that in 25 of these countries ( including the united states ) , between 60 % and 80 % ( or 6 to 8 out of every 10 ) of all iv drug users had hepatitis c. and china .
most experience very few or no symptoms during the first decades of the infection , although chronic hepatitis c can cause fatigue ( feeling tired ) .
hepatitis c can be spread through needles , syringes , and medication vials ( or containers ) that are re-used ; through infusion bags ( which are used to pump medications into a person 's body ; and through surgical equipment that is not sterile ( or clean and free of germs ) .

the exceptions to this are yellow fever and dengue viruses , which still require mosquito vectors , but are well-enough adapted to humans as to not necessarily depend upon animal hosts ( although both continue have important animal transmission routes as well ) .
flaviviruses are named from the yellow fever virus , a type virus for the flaviviridae family ; flavus means yellow in latin .
human infections with these viruses are typically incidental , as humans are unable to replicate the virus to high enough titers to reinfect arthropods and thus continue the virus life cycle .
for example , early tests with yellow fever showed that the disease is not a contagious disease .
yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause yellow jaundice in victims .

the heterozygote has a permanent advantage ( a higher fitness ) so long as malaria exists ; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time .
such a balance is seen more simply in sickle-cell anemia , which is found mostly in tropical populations in africa and india .
the sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills a huge number of people each year .
because the heterozygote survives , so does the hgbs allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate .
the life expectancy of the standard hemoglobin ( hgba ) homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal ( though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems ) .
this is heterozygote advantage , a kind of balance between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers , and selection against the standard hgba homozygotes by malaria .

people who suffer from psychosis are said to be psychotic .
about 1 percent of people suffer from psychosis during their lives .
people with psychosis may have hallucinations , which means they can experience things that are not really there .
risk factors include poverty , malnutrition , deforestation and urbanization .
about 200 million people in asia , africa , south and central america and southern europe live in areas where the disease is common .
the treatment needed is determined by where the disease is acquired , the species of leishmania and the type of infection .
amastigotes multiply in infected cells and affect different tissues , depending in part on which leishmania species is involved ( 4 ) .
medications used for the visceral form include : liposomal amphotericin b , a combination of pentavalent antimonials and paromomycin , and miltefosine .
leishmaniasis can be partly prevented by sleeping under nets treated with insecticide .
the disease has three forms : leishmaniasis in humans is caused by more than 20 species of leishmania .
these can transmit the infection leishmania .
leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bite of infected female sandflies .
the world health organization has gotten discounts on some medications to treat the disease .
the genomes of three leishmania species have been sequenced and this has provided much information about the biology of the parasite .
leishmania has unique features with respect to the regulation of gene expression in response to changes in the environment .
another way is using insecticides to kill sandflies .
leishmaniasis or leishmaniosis is a disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus leishmania .
the visceral form can be diagnosed with a blood test .

syphilis can not be spread through toilet seats , daily activities , hot tubs , or sharing eating utensils ( like forks or spoons ) or clothing .
many people who have secondary syphilis ( 40-85 % of women , 20-65 % of men ) do not report having had the classic chancre during the primary stage of syphilis .
syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacterium , treponema pallidum .
secondary syphilis can appear in many different ways , but symptoms usually involve the skin , mucous membranes ( like the nose , throat , genitals , or anus ) , and lymph nodes .
people with tertiary syphilis are not infectious ( they can not infect other people with syphilis at this stage ) .
sometimes , there is a reddish-pink , non-itchy rash on the chest , back and extremities ( hands and feet ) , including the palms and soles .
without treatment , one-third of people who are infected with syphilis ( one in every three people with syphilis ) get tertiary disease .
if a person is allergic to penicillin , other antibiotics like ceftriaxone , doxycycline , or tetracycline can be used , but they have to be given over longer periods of time .
in the early latent syphilis stage , a person can have a relapse of symptoms , meaning that his symptoms can come back after having gotten better .
sometimes , late syphilis can also be treated with intramuscular penicillin g ( given as a shot into the muscle ) , but the medication has to be given once a week for three weeks .
usually , the first treatment that is used is either a single dose of penicillin g , given intramuscularly ( given with a needle as a shot into the muscle ) , or a single dose of oral azithromycin .
most new cases of syphilis in the united states happen in men who have sex with men ( who , specifically , get 60 % of new cases , or 6 out of every 10 ) .
people usually get primary syphilis by having direct sexual contact with infectious lesions - wounds caused by syphilis - on the genitals of a person who already has syphilis .
late neurosyphilis can also cause argyll robertson pupils , which causes a person 's pupils ( the black circles in the middle of their eyes ) to be smaller than usual ; the pupils also constrict ( or get smaller ) when the person focuses their eyes on objects that are close by , but they do not constrict after seeing bright lights , like normal pupils do .
however , not everybody who is exposed to primary or secondary syphilis will get the disease .
neurosyphilis is an infection that involves the central nervous system ( the brain and spinal cord ) .
syphilis is transmitted ( or spread ) mostly by sexual contact or during pregnancy from a mother to her fetus .
late latent syphilis does not have any specific symptoms , and it is not as contagious ( meaning that it does not spread as easily ) as early latent syphilis .
in the united kingdom , latent syphilis is called early if it has been less than two years since the secondary stage , and it is called late if it has been more than two years .
in each stage , the signs and symptoms of syphilis are different .

widespread private concerns have led to a number of folklore sayings and popular culture reflections related to penis size .
the perception of having a large penis is linked to higher self-esteem .
at utrecht university was found that the majority of homosexual men regarded a large penis as ideal , and having one was linked to self-esteem .
an adult penis with an erect length of less than 7 cm but otherwise formed normally is referred to as having the micropenis condition .
studies found that many men who believed that their penis was of inadequate size had average-sized penises .
flaccid length is not a reliable indication of erect length .
the size depends on arousal level , time of day , room temperature , frequency of sexual activity , and unreliability of the measurement methods .

balanchine died in 1983 of creutzfeldt-jakob disease .
according to the world health organization , a pandemic can start when three conditions have been met : a disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people ; it must also be infectious .
for example cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious ( although certain causes of some types of cancer might be ) .
a pandemic ( from greek παν pan all + δήμος demos people ) is an epidemic ( an outbreak of an infectious disease ) that spreads across a large region ( for example a continent ) , or even worldwide .

their oldest died in a tragic boating accident and another died from childhood meningitis .
pavlovian conditioning was a major theme in aldous huxley 's dystopian novel , brave new world , and also to a large degree in thomas pynchon 's gravity 's rainbow .
pavlov 's research on conditional reflexes greatly influenced not only science , but also popular culture .
in the 1890s , pavlov was investigating the gastric function of dogs by externalizing a salivary gland so he could collect , measure , and analyze the saliva and what response it had to food under different conditions .
as pavlov 's work became known in the west , particularly through the writings of john b. watson , the idea of `` conditioning '' as an automatic form of learning became a key concept in the developing specialism of comparative psychology , and the general approach to psychology called behaviourism .
littman tentatively attributed the popular imagery to pavlov 's contemporaries vladimir bekhterev and john b. watson , until thomas found several references that clearly said pavlov did , indeed , use a bell .
it is less widely known that pavlov 's experiments on the conditional reflex included children , some of whom apparently underwent surgical procedures , similar to the dogs , for the collection of saliva .
the concept for which pavlov is famous is the `` conditioned reflex '' he developed with his assistant ivan tolochinov in 1901 .
as her father put it , child analysis had received a powerful impetus through `` the work of frau melanie klein and of my daughter , anna freud '' .

the red crescent society has helped millions of pakistanis overcome disease and disaster , by offering support services for pakistanis , which include , food , clean water , and medical services .
it may be due to the gradual failure in the `` satellite cells '' which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers , and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival .
muscular atrophy also increases the risks of falling among people with certain medical conditions , such as ibm ( inclusion body myositis ) .
muscle atrophy can also happen to people with certain diseases or medical conditions , like cancer , aids , congestive heart failure , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , and renal failure ( where the kidneys do not work correctly ) .

in humans , the pigment of the iris varies from light brown to black .
eye color is a visible character caused by two factors : the pigmentation of the eye 's iris , and way light is scattered as it hits the top layer of the iris .
this depends on the amount of melanin in the iris .
the terms hetrochromia iridis ( = different color of the iris ) , heterochromia iridum ( plural form ) and heterochromia iridium ( a mistake in latin grammar ) are variously used when it is the eye color which is specifically mentioned .

later outbreaks of bubonic plague in italy include the city of florence in 1630-1633 and the areas surrounding naples , rome and genoa in 1656-1657 .
the papal city of bologna lost an estimated 15,000 citizens to the plague , with neighboring smaller cities of modena and parma also being heavily affected .
german and french troops carried the plague to the city of mantua in 1629 , as a result of troop movements associated with the thirty years ' war ( 1618-1648 ) .
this outbreak of plague also spread north into tyrol , an alpine region of western austria and northern italy .
venetian troops , infected with the disease , retreated into northern and central italy , spreading the infection .
in october 1629 , the plague reached milan , lombardy 's commercial center .
the italian plague of 1629-1631 was a series of outbreaks of bubonic plague from 1629 through 1631 in northern italy .
this episode is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries long pandemic of bubonic plague which began with the black death .
this epidemic , often called the great plague of milan , killed about 280,000 people .

a number of medications are useful for preventing further episodes of gout , including xanthine oxidase inhibitor ( including allopurinol and febuxostat ) , and uricosurics ( including probenecid and sulfinpyrazone ) .
other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count , electrolytes , renal function , and erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) .
both the white blood cells and esr may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection .
extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion .
however , a low dose of hydrochlorothiazide does not seem to increase the risk .
pegloticase ( krystexxa ) was approved in the usa to treat gout in 2010 .
diuretics are associated with attacks of gout .
this should be considered in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment .
urate-lowering measures should be increased until serum uric acid levels are below 300-360 µmol \/ l ( 5.0-6 .0 mg\/dl ) .
other conditions which present similarly include pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis .
gout was historically known as `` the disease of kings '' or `` the disease of rich men '' .
a white blood cell count as high as 40.0 × 109\/l ( 40,000 \/ mm3 ) has been documented in people with gout .
gout can present in a number of ways , although the most common is a recurrent attack of intense inflammatory arthritis ( a red , tender , hot , swollen joint ) .
hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol \/ l ( 7.0 mg\/dl ) in males and 360 μmol \/ l ( 6.0 mg\/dl ) in females .
a very high , abnormal level of uric acid in the blood ( hyperuricemia ) is the basic cause of gout .
a definitive diagnosis of gout is based upon the identification of monosodium urate ( msu ) crystals in joint fluid or a tophus .
about 10 % of people with hyperuricemia develop gout at some point in their lives .
the immunosuppressive drugs ciclosporin and tacrolimus are also associated with gout .
gout occurs nearly half of the time without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout .
other medicines associated with causing gout attacks include niacin and aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) .
gout often makes these other problems worse or harder to treat : polycythemia , lead poisoning , renal failure , hemolytic anemia , psoriasis , and solid organ transplants .
this treatment is not recommended until a person has suffered two gout attacks , unless destructive joint changes , tophi , or urate nephropathy exist .
two genes called slc2a9 and abcg2 are commonly associated with gout .
high levels of uric acid in the blood over a long period of time ( hyperuricemia ) may cause other symptoms such as hard , painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi .
metabolic syndrome , longer life expectancy , and changes in diet are the most common risk factors .
xanthine oxidase inhibitors ( including allopurinol and febuxostat ) block uric acid production .
the most important diagnosis to rule out in gout is septic arthritis ( an infection in the joint ) .
the disease may also appear as tophi , kidney stones , or urate nephropathy ( kidney disease due to urate crystals ) .
gout ( also known as podagra when it involves the largest toe ) is a medical condition .
its side effects , primarily gastrointestinal upset limit its use .
gout often happens with other medical problems .
gout has become more common .
a joint infection must be excluded if the condition worsens .
overproduction of uric acid is the cause in less than 10 % of all cases .
frequent lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout because lead harms the kidney function .
males have three times the chance of getting gout when the body mass index is greater than or equal to 35 .
nsaids are the most common treatment for gout .
eating purine-rich vegetables ( e.g. , beans , peas , lentils , and spinach ) large amounts of protein do not contribute to developing gout .
the occurrence of gastrointestinal upset depends on the dose .
when uric acid levels in the blood are between 415 and 530 μmol \/ l ( 7 and 8.9 mg\/dl ) , the chance of getting gout is 0.5 % per year .
uricosuric drugs are preferred for treating gout if there is not enough uric acid in the urine defined by a 24-hour collection of urine with less than 800 mg of uric acid .
this causes stone formation followed by urate nephropathy .
inherited factors are about 60 % responsible for the variability in uric acid level .
ectopic pregnancies are also called tubal pregnancies because they usually occur in a fallopian tube .
there are two main ways to treat an ectopic pregnancy .
because in an ectopic pregnancy the egg grows ( usually ) in the fallopian tube , the fallopian tube can become damaged , making it more likely for another egg to get stuck there .
the likeness of another ectopic pregnancy depends on the amount of damage to the fallopian tube , and the health of the tubes .

werner huttig of the nazi party 's rassenpolitisches amt ( office of racial politics ) claimed smoking mothers ' breast milk contained nicotine .
the nazi anti-tobacco campaign used many methods like restrictions on smoking in public spaces , limiting tobacco advertising , restrictions on tobacco rations for women , restrictions on restaurants and coffeehouses , promoting health education , banning smoking in trams , buses and city trains , limiting cigarette rations in the wehrmacht , organizing medical lectures for soldiers and increasing the tobacco tax .
women who smoked were considered to be more likely to age prematurely , and lose physical attractiveness ; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a german family .
adolf hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life , smoking 25 to 40 cigarettes daily .
but smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945 .
example : baldness in humans .
sex-influenced or sex-conditioned traits are phenotypes affected by whether they appear in a male or female body .
even in a homozygous female the condition may not be expressed fully .
however , if the mutant allele is carried by a male , the condition will develop , because his x chromosome has the mutant allele , but his y chromosome has no allele at that locus .
they are caused by recessive alleles , and usually do not show the condition in females .

building occupants complain of symptoms such as irritation of the eyes , nose , throat ; neurotoxic or general health problems ; skin irritation ; nonspecific hypersensitivity reactions ; and odor and taste sensations .
other causes have been contaminants produced by outgassing of some types of building materials , volatile organic compounds ( voc ) , molds ( see mold health issues ) , improper exhaust ventilation of ozone ( byproduct of some office machinery ) , using light industrial chemicals in the building , or lack of adequate fresh-air intake\/air filtration ( see minimum efficiency reporting value ) .
the following steps can avoid sbs : there might be a gender difference in reporting rates of sick building syndrome because women tend to report more symptoms than men .
sbs can be caused by flaws in the heating , ventilation , and air conditioning ( hvac ) systems .
janitors should minimize the ongoing use of voc cleaning compounds , and eliminate conditions that encourage allergenic , potentially-deadly mold growth .
this is a real-life example from a medical study comparing the success rates of two treatments for kidney stones .
the table shows the success rates and numbers of treatments for treatments involving both small and large kidney stones , where treatment a includes all open procedures and treatment b is percutaneous nephrolithotomy : the paradoxical conclusion is that treatment a is more effective when used on small stones , and also when used on large stones , yet treatment b is more effective when considering both sizes at the same time .

at the time it was generally thought that the point at which the optic nerve entered the eye should actually be the most sensitive portion of the retina ; however , mariotte 's discovery disproved this theory .
in them , the optic nerve approaches the receptors from behind , so it does not create a break in the retina .
since there are no cells to detect light on the optic disc , a part of the field of vision is not perceived .
it is the place in the visual field that corresponds to the lack of light-detecting photoreceptor cells where the optic nerve passes through the optic disc of the retina .

it is a method for influencing one 's autonomic nervous system .
autogenic training is counter-indicated , or needs to be adapted , for a series of conditions including : heart problems such as myocardial infarction , diabetes , psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia , glaucoma , alcohol or drug abuse , epilepsy .
these include altered heart sounds , such as a widely split s2 or second heart sound , a loud p2 or pulmonic valve closure sound ( part of the second heart sound ) , ( para ) sternal heave , possible s3 or third heart sound , and pulmonary regurgitation .
further procedures are required to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension and exclude other possible diagnoses .
a swan-ganz catheter can also measure the cardiac output , which is far more important in measuring disease severity than the pulmonary arterial pressure .
the revised system developed by this group provides the current framework for understanding pulmonary hypertension .
three major pathways are involved in abnormal proliferation and contraction of the smooth-muscle cells of the pulmonary artery in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension .
this delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis .
a physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension .
diagnosis of pah requires the presence of pulmonary hypertension with two other conditions .
depending on the cause , pulmonary hypertension can be a severe disease with a markedly decreased exercise tolerance and right-sided heart failure .
a detailed family history is taken to determine whether the disease might be familial .
physical examination is performed to look for typical signs of pulmonary hypertension including a loud p2 ( pulmonic valve closure sound ) , ( para ) sternal heave , jugular venous distension , pedal edema , ascites , hepatojugular reflux , clubbing etc. .
these generally include pulmonary function tests , blood tests , electrocardiography ( ecg ) , arterial blood gas measurements , x-rays of the chest ( followed by high-resolution ct scanning if interstitial lung disease is suspected ) , and ventilation-perfusion or v\/q scanning to exclude chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension .
because pulmonary hypertension can be of 5 major types , a series of tests must be performed to distinguish pulmonary arterial hypertension from venous , hypoxic , thomboembolic , or miscellaneous varieties .
a history of exposure to cocaine , methamphetamine , alcohol leading to cirrhosis , and smoking leading to emphysema are considered significant .

in 2003 , the 3rd world symposium on pulmonary arterial hypertension was convened in venice to modify the classification based on the new understanding of disease mechanisms .
in addition , the increased workload of the heart causes thickening and enlargement of the right ventricle , making the heart less able to pump blood through the lungs , causing right heart failure .
whatever the initial cause , pulmonary hypertension involves the tightening of blood vessels connected to and within the lungs .
in medicine , pulmonary hypertension ( ph ) is an increase in blood pressure in the pulmonary artery or lung vasculature , leading to shortness of breath , dizziness , fainting , and other symptoms , all of which are exacerbated by exertion .

masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids .
semen is valued and masturbation is seen as a waste of semen and is therefore frowned upon even though frequent ejaculation is encouraged .
in this and other tribes , the measure of manhood is actually associated more with the amount of ejaculate and his need than penis size .
in these cases , any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic .
a man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma or injury during intercourse may rarely sustain a penile fracture or suffer from peyronie 's disease .
and while doctors have no proof of this actually being true , those suffering from cardiovascular disorders ( particularly those recovering from myocardial infarction , or heart attacks ) should resume physical activity ( including sexual intercourse and masturbation ) gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow .
the capacity and need to ejaculate is nurtured for years from an early age through fellatio so that it can be consumed rather than wasted .
this is consistent with a 2003 australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer some people actually use masturbation as part of their cardiovascular workout and for stress relief masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases .
the study also indicated that this would be more helpful than ejaculation through sexual intercourse because intercourse can transmit diseases that may increase the risk of cancer instead .
in 2003 , an australian research team led by graham giles of the cancer council australia concluded that frequent masturbation by males appears to help prevent the development of prostate cancer .
usually the man will hold the penis ( in erection ) in his hand and move the hand up and down .

it used to be thought that clinically active pituitary adenomas were rare but recent studies have suggested that they may affect about one in 1000 of the general population .
pituitary adenomas are tumors that occur in the pituitary gland .
pituitary adenomas represent from 10 % to 25 % of all brain tumors and is thought to happen in about 17 % to 25 % of most people .
pituitary tumors are generally divided into three kinds dependant upon their biological functioning : benign adenoma , invasive adenoma or carcinomas , with carcinomas accounting for 0.1 % to 0.2 % , appoximately 35 % being invasive adenomas and most being benign adenomas .
non-invasive and non-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered to be benign ( harmless ) ; but a recent large study ( fernández-balsells , et al. 2011 ) has shown there are few studies to prove if this is true or not .
most pituitary microadenomas often remain undiagnosed and those that are diagnosed are often found as an incidental finding ( which means found by chance ) , and are called incidentalomas .
